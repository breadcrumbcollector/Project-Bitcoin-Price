This study attempts to explain the market price of Bitcoin with coding language R. The codes illustrate a multilinear regression analysis of a large time series data set to understand and explain the price of Bitcoin.

I hypothesized that the following explanatory variables (Price Volatility, S&P 500, Crude Oil, JPY to USD Exchange rate, Mining Difficulty, Transaction Fees, Volume, Average Block Size, Number of Transactions, Search Interest, Inflation, British Pound to USD Exchange rate, Euro to USD Exchange rate and Gold) will have an impact on the market price of bitcoin.

The main findings are that JPY/USD exchange rate, EUR/USD exchange rate, transaction fees, trading volume, US Inflation Rates, S&P 500 have had the largest impact on the market price of Bitcoin.
